### My Professional Value Proposition

I am a problem solver by nature, especially well suited to seemingly intractable, strategically important initiatives whether they be legacy or green field solutions.  I use my extensive experience, listening skills, tenacity and patience to unravel and solve enabling technologies for organizations.

I am a keen observer and look before I leap.  As a sensitive person, I take notice of subtle indications of potential problematic situations and treats to the long term viability of solutions.  I can thus provide council to any team in need of contemplative balance.

I can lead a small team of motivated, subject matter experts on tactical execution of strategic initiatives in customer’s core business domain.

Philosophical and spiritual, titles and salaries are not my main motivators.  I find inspiration and drive in solving problems that enable breakthroughs that impact people’s lives in positive ways and move our world to a better place.
